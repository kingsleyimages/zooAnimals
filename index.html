            Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are
            classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight
            species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a
            wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere
            and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the
            continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common
            characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky
            legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws
            with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

            The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
            Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
            ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
            one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most
            recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant
            species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear
            DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat
            patterns. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the
            fossil record.

            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native
            to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short,
            rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its
            tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than
            females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming
            groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,
            related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt
            together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The
            lion is an apex and keystone predator.

          <p>
            Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
            infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all
            animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
            except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an
            incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense
            based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the
            terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.

            An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the genus
            Alligator of the family Alligatoridae of the order Crocodilia. The
            two extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis)
            and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). Additionally, several
            extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains.
            Alligators first appeared during the late Eocene epoch about 37
            million years ago.[1]
